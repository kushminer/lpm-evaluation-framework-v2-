## Quick Summary

| Plot | Key Message |
|------|-------------|
| **Curvature Sweep** | Small neighborhoods (k=5-10) are optimal → manifold is locally smooth |
| **Baseline Comparison** | PCA wins; deep learning ≈ random embeddings |
| **Similarity vs Performance** | High similarity → high accuracy (mechanistic explanation) |

---

## 📊 Plot 1: Curvature Sweep

### Why This Plot?
This is the **smoking gun** for the Manifold Law. It directly tests whether biological perturbation responses lie on a locally smooth manifold.

### What It Proves
1. **Local smoothness** - Best predictions at small k (5-10 neighbors)
2. **Dataset generality** - Pattern holds across easy (Adamson) and hard (K562) datasets
3. **Embedding quality** - PCA preserves local geometry; deep models don't

### Core Message
> *"You only need your nearest neighbors. The manifold is locally smooth."*

### Available Versions

| File | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `curvature_stratified_3panel.png` | 3 panels by dataset difficulty | Full paper figure |
| `curvature_easy_vs_hard.png` | 2 panels: Easy vs Hard datasets | Poster - shows generalization |
| `curvature_clean_single.png` | Single panel, all data averaged | Slide presentation |
| `curvature_lsft_lift.png` | Shows improvement over baseline | Technical supplement |

### Figure Title (for poster)
> **"The Manifold is Locally Smooth: Prediction Accuracy vs Neighborhood Size"**

### Figure Description
> Local similarity-filtered training (LSFT) predicts perturbation responses with near-perfect accuracy (r > 0.9) using only 5-10 nearest neighbors. Performance is stable or slightly degrades as neighborhood size increases, confirming that biological response manifolds are locally smooth. Self-trained PCA embeddings consistently outperform pretrained deep learning models (scGPT, scFoundation) which perform no better than random embeddings.

## 📊 Plot 2: Baseline Comparison

### Why This Plot?
This is the **headline result** - a simple comparison everyone can understand.

### What It Proves
1. **Self-trained PCA wins** by a large margin on all datasets
2. **Deep learning fails** - scGPT/scFoundation perform no better than random
3. **Generalization** - Pattern holds across easy, medium, and hard datasets

### Core Message
> *"Billion-parameter pretrained models add no value. Simple beats complex."*

### Available Versions

| File | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `baseline_comparison_all_datasets.png` | Grouped bars, all 3 datasets | Full paper figure |
| `baseline_adamson_simple.png` | Horizontal bars, Adamson only | Poster - clean & simple |

### Figure Title (for poster)
> **"Self-Trained PCA Beats Deep Learning Embeddings"**

### Figure Description
> Comparison of six embedding methods across three datasets of varying difficulty. Self-trained PCA embeddings achieve the highest prediction accuracy (r = 0.94 on Adamson, 0.66 on K562). Pretrained deep learning models (scGPT, scFoundation) perform nearly identically to random gene embeddings, indicating that pretraining on large corpora does not capture perturbation-specific manifold structure.

## 📊 Plot 3: Similarity vs Performance

### Why This Plot?
This explains the **mechanism** - WHY the manifold law works.

### What It Proves
1. **Positive correlation** - Higher similarity → higher accuracy
2. **Top neighbors matter** - The top 15% most similar neighbors give near-perfect predictions
3. **Not about model** - It's about neighborhood quality

### Core Message
> *"The magic is in the neighbors, not the model."*

### Available Versions

| File | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `similarity_vs_performance_clean.png` | Scatter plot with trend line | Technical paper |
| `similarity_vs_performance_binned.png` | Binned by percentile, cleaner trend | Poster - shows clear relationship |

### Figure Title (for poster)
> **"Similarity Explains Performance: The Manifold is Smooth"**

### Figure Description
> Prediction accuracy correlates with mean cosine similarity to training neighbors. When using PCA embeddings, perturbations in the top 15% similarity percentile achieve near-perfect predictions (r > 0.9). This confirms that the response manifold is locally smooth: similar perturbations induce similar transcriptional responses, enabling accurate local interpolation.

## Mechanistic Explanations: Why Linear Models Win

**These plots explain WHY PCA systematically outperforms deep learning models across LSFT, LOGO, and baseline predictions.**

### WHY_variance_explained.png
**"PCA Captures More Predictive Variance in Embedding Space"**

**Purpose:** Shows that PCA extracts more useful information from the embedding space than deep learning models.

**What it shows:**
- 3-panel plot comparing variance captured (LSFT improvement over baseline) across Adamson, K562, and RPE1 datasets
- PCA consistently shows the largest improvement (Δr = LSFT - baseline)
- Deep learning models (scGPT, scFoundation) show much smaller improvements
- Random embeddings show negligible improvement

**Key insight:** PCA is better at preserving the low-dimensional structure that contains predictive information.

### WHY_consistency_is_key.png
**"PCA Shows More Consistent Performance Across Perturbations"**

**Purpose:** Demonstrates that PCA has more reliable performance across different perturbations.

**What it shows:**
- 3-panel plot showing coefficient of variation (consistency measure) vs mean performance
- Lower coefficient of variation = more consistent performance
- PCA clusters show lower variability and higher mean performance
- Deep learning models show more scattered, inconsistent results

**Key insight:** Linear models provide reliable performance regardless of perturbation characteristics.

### WHY_failure_rate.png
**"PCA Fails Less Catastrophically on Hard Perturbations"**

**Purpose:** Shows that PCA is more robust to challenging perturbations.

**What it shows:**
- 3-panel plot comparing failure rates (r < 0) on easy vs hard perturbations
- Hard perturbations defined as bottom quartile of baseline performance
- PCA has lower failure rates on both easy and hard perturbations
- Deep learning models fail catastrophically on hard perturbations

**Key insight:** Linear models are more robust and don't break down on challenging cases.

### WHY_manifold_alignment.png
**"PCA Shows Better Manifold Alignment Across All Metrics"**

**Purpose:** Comprehensive view of how well different embeddings align with the perturbation manifold.

**What it shows:**
- 4-panel plot with multiple alignment metrics:
  - Distribution of improvements over baseline
  - Improvement vs similarity correlation
  - Mean improvement by dataset
  - Summary statistics table
- PCA consistently shows the best alignment metrics
- Clear separation between linear (PCA) and nonlinear (deep learning) methods

**Key insight:** The perturbation manifold is locally linear, so linear methods capture its structure better.

### WHY_generalization_gap.png
**"PCA Shows Better Generalization from Local to Global"**

**Purpose:** Tests how well local predictions (LSFT) generalize to global predictions (LOGO).

**What it shows:**
- Bar chart showing generalization gap (LSFT - LOGO performance)
- Positive gap = better generalization from local neighborhoods to global holdout
- PCA shows the best generalization (largest positive gap)
- Deep learning models show smaller or negative gaps

**Key insight:** Linear models learned locally transfer better to global prediction tasks.

### WHY_summary.png
**"Why Linear Models (PCA) Systematically Outperform Deep Learning"**

**Purpose:** Unified summary of all mechanistic explanations.

**What it shows:**
- 6-panel comprehensive summary:
  1. More variance captured
  2. More consistent performance
  3. Fewer catastrophic failures
  4. Better generalization
  5. Better manifold alignment
  6. Overall conclusion text box
- Clear visual hierarchy showing PCA superiority across all metrics

**Key insight:** The systematic advantage of linear models suggests that biological perturbation responses lie on locally smooth, low-dimensional manifolds that linear methods capture more effectively than deep nonlinear networks.
