## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Framework Setup
- [x] Created audit folder structure
- [x] Created ablation study framework
- [x] Created annotation improvement framework
- [x] Created validation framework
- [x] Analyzed "Other" class composition for all datasets

### ✅ Analysis Results

**Adamson**:
- "Other" class: 12 genes (14.6% of total)
- Genes: ARHGAP22, ASCC3, CCND3, MRGBP, MRPL39, PPWD1, TELO2, TTI1, TTI2, UFL1, XRN1, ctrl

**K562/RPE1**:
- "Other" class: 381 genes (34.9% of total, 54.7% of training data)
- This is the major concern

## Next Steps

### Task 1: Ablation Study
1. Run `audits/logo/ablation_study/run_logo_ablation.py`
   - This will run LOGO excluding "Other" from training
   - Outputs to `ablation_study/results/`

2. Run `audits/logo/ablation_study/compare_results.py`
   - Compares standard vs ablation results
   - Quantifies impact (Δr, % change)

### Task 2: Annotation Improvement
1. Implement GO term queries in `improve_annotations.py`
   - Query GO database for "Other" genes
   - Map GO terms to functional classes

2. Implement expression similarity analysis
   - Compute class mean expression profiles
   - Correlate "Other" genes with class profiles

3. Generate improved annotations
   - Combine GO and expression data
   - Create new annotation files (backup originals)

4. Validate improved annotations
   - Run validation framework
   - Check consistency and quality

5. Re-run LOGO with improved annotations
   - Measure impact of annotation improvements

## Key Files

### Analysis Scripts
- `annotation_improvement/analyze_other_class.py` - ✅ Working
- `ablation_study/run_logo_ablation.py` - Framework ready
- `ablation_study/compare_results.py` - Framework ready

### Validation
- `annotation_improvement/validate_annotations.py` - Framework ready
- Validation strategies documented in `annotation_improvement/README.md`

### Improvement
- `annotation_improvement/improve_annotations.py` - Framework ready
- Requires implementation of GO queries and expression analysis

## Principles

1. **Never modify original files** - All scripts create backups
2. **Track all changes** - Documented in audit files
3. **Validate improvements** - Multiple validation strategies
4. **Compare systematically** - Consistent metrics

## Notes

- Original annotation files are never modified
- All improved annotations go to `improved_annotations/` directory
- Backups are timestamped in `improved_annotations/backups/`
- Results are saved to `results/` directory
