# LOGO Method Audit

## Purpose

This audit investigates and addresses the impact of the "Other" functional class on LOGO (Leave-One-GO-Out) evaluation results.

## Problem Statement

The current LOGO implementation includes ALL non-holdout classes in training, including a potentially large and heterogeneous "Other" class. This may be inflating performance on Transcription prediction.

### Key Findings from Initial Analysis

- **K562/RPE1**: "Other" represents **54.7% of training data** (381/696 perturbations)
- **Adamson**: "Other" represents **15.6% of training data** (12/77 perturbations)
- **Class imbalance ratio**: 54.4x (largest vs smallest class)

## Key Results

### Task 1: Ablation Study ✅ COMPLETE

**Question**: Does excluding "Other" from training affect LOGO performance?

**Answer**: 
- **Adamson**: Minimal impact (Δr = +0.0030, -0.5%)
- **K562**: Moderate impact (Δr = -0.0231, -4.6%) - "Other" helps performance
- **RPE1**: Minimal impact (Δr = -0.0048, -0.5%)

**Conclusion**: Impact is dataset-specific. For K562, "Other" class has positive impact on performance.

### Task 2: Annotation Improvement ✅ IN PROGRESS

**Results**:
- **Adamson**: 91.7% reduction (11/12 genes reassigned)
- **K562**: 84.8% reduction (323/381 genes reassigned)
- **RPE1**: 74.3% reduction (283/381 genes reassigned)

**Method**: Expression similarity (correlate "Other" genes with class mean profiles)

## Usage

### Run Ablation Study
```bash
python audits/logo/ablation_study/run_logo_ablation.py
python audits/logo/ablation_study/compare_results.py
```

### Improve Annotations
```bash
# Expression similarity method
python audits/logo/annotation_improvement/expression_similarity_assignments.py

# GO term method (requires mygene)
python audits/logo/annotation_improvement/improve_annotations_with_go.py

# Validate reassignments
python audits/logo/annotation_improvement/validate_reassignments.py
```

## Key Principles

1. **Never modify original files** - Always create backups and new files
2. **Track all changes** - Document what was changed and why
3. **Validate improvements** - Ensure annotation improvements are correct
4. **Compare systematically** - Use consistent evaluation metrics

## Files

- Original annotations: `data/annotations/`
- Improved annotations: `audits/logo/annotation_improvement/improved_annotations/`
- Backups: `audits/logo/annotation_improvement/improved_annotations/backups/`
- Results: `audits/logo/results/`

## Status

- ✅ Task 1 (Ablation Study): Complete
- ✅ Task 2 (Expression Similarity): Complete
- ⏳ Task 2 (GO Term Assignments): In progress
- ⏳ Re-run LOGO with improved annotations: Pending
