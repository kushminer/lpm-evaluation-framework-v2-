## 🔎 CODE VALIDATED (7-phase audit)

**No data leakage**  
✓ Train/test/val splits have zero overlap  
✓ PCA fit on training only  
✓ Test embeddings use transform only  

**Correct LOGO split**  
✓ Transcription class correctly isolated in test set  

**Correct LSFT implementation**  
✓ Similarity computed on training embeddings only  
✓ Top-K neighbors selected from training set only  

**Correct metrics**  
✓ Pearson r (scipy.stats.pearsonr)  
✓ L2 distance (Euclidean)  
✓ Bootstrap CI (percentile method)  
✓ Permutation test (sign-flip)  

**Toy model perfect match**  
✓ r = 1.0 (exact ground truth match)
